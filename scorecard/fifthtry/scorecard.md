## Rule reference

<summary>How each rule works and how to fix failures</summary>

### Scored rules

#### Has branch protection

Checks that the default branch enforces pull-request flow: direct pushes are blocked and merges go through a PR. On public scans the require-PR sub-setting of classic protection isn't visible (it's admin-gated), so an enabled classic protection passes this rule whether or not it actually requires a PR; the rulesets `pull_request` rule is the precise public signal. To fix: add a `pull_request` ruleset rule on the default branch, or enable "Require a pull request before merging" in classic branch protection. [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches).

#### Has required checks

Checks that the default branch requires at least one programmatic check (CI status check, workflow run, code scan, deployment, etc.) to pass before merging. To fix: add a check requirement on the default branch via Rulesets or classic branch protection.

#### Has CODEOWNERS

Checks for a CODEOWNERS file in any of the three locations GitHub honors: the repo root, `.github/`, or `docs/`. To fix: add a CODEOWNERS file in one of those locations mapping paths to GitHub users or teams. [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners).

#### Has CI workflow

Checks for a checked-in CI configuration file from any of the major providers: GitHub Actions (any `.yml` or `.yaml` file under `.github/workflows/`), CircleCI (`.circleci/config.yml`), GitLab CI (`.gitlab-ci.yml`), Travis (`.travis.yml`), Buildkite (any file under `.buildkite/`), Azure Pipelines (`azure-pipelines.yml`), or Jenkins (`Jenkinsfile`). Setups whose configuration lives entirely server-side (no checked-in file) are not detected. To fix: add a workflow file for the provider you use. The simplest path on GitHub is a YAML workflow under `.github/workflows/`. [GitHub Actions quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart).

---

### Additional checks

#### Has README

Checks for a README file at the repository root. The match is case-insensitive and accepts any extension or none, so `README.md`, `README.rst`, `README.txt`, `Readme`, `readme.markdown` all pass. READMEs in subdirectories don't count. To fix: add a top-level README that explains what the project is, how to install it, and how to use it.

#### Has LICENSE

Checks GitHub's auto-detected license field, which GitHub populates by running the Licensee gem against the repo and recognizing conventionally-named license files: `LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md`, `LICENSE.txt`, `LICENCE`, `COPYING`, `MIT-LICENSE`, and similar variants. Custom-text licenses Licensee can't classify won't pass even if a file is present. To fix: pick a license at [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com) and add it to your repo root using one of the recognized filenames. GitHub will detect it automatically.

#### Has repo description

Checks that the repository's description field (set via the About panel, shown at the top of the GitHub repo page) is non-empty. To fix: edit the repo's About panel and add a one-line description.

#### Has activity

Checks that the repository has had a commit (push) within the last 12 months, based on GitHub's `pushed_at` timestamp on the repo. To fix: push a commit, or archive the repository if it's no longer maintained.

#### Has SECURITY.md

Checks for a SECURITY.md file in any of the three locations GitHub recognizes for security policies: the repo root, `.github/`, or `docs/`. To fix: add a SECURITY.md describing how to report vulnerabilities. [GitHub's template](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository).
